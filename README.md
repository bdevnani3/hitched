A carpooling app that allows you to : 
1. Collect people from point A and allow them to travel to point B
2. Also account for travellers who want to picked up/ dropped off along the route based on calculation of feasibility of doing so.

The feasibility is calculated based on location, distance off route and increase in time of travel.

This was developed at HackNC and was inspired by the fact that we didn't have people to carpool with to get there.
